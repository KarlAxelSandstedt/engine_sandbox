General Notes 
=============

This project is a game/physics engine in progress. Currently most development efforts
are put into the 3D physics engine, the engine's UI library, and the platform independent
base layer. 
 

Usage
=====

When running the program, two windows will pop up. The first window displays the 
profiler. The timeline is draggable using left-click. If you press control + 
left-click while dragging you will zoom-in or out of the timeline. 

The second window displays the simulation and simulation related data.  click the
colored run, pause or stop signs at the top of the window to interact with the 
simulation. By clicking on the display region of the simulation you enter focused
mode and can move the camera using the WASD-keys and the mouse. To exit focus mode,
you press Escape.  In the bottom-right you will find additional display options. 
4 checkbox options and a dropdown menu displaying the current rigid body coloring mode.


Installing on Windows 
=====================

1. Download and run the installer. 

2. Make sure to set the install path to a directory you own, such as 
".../user/programs/engine_sandbox" so that you can run the exe without elevated 
privileges.


Installing on Linux
===================

Compiling on Windows 
====================

Compiling on Linux
==================

Requirements: Some modern version of CMake.

1. Clone the repository and all of its submodules:

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KarlAxelSandstedt/engine_sandbox.git

2. Compile and run the codebase by calling any of the following options.

run.sh:
Compile the code with optimization options turned on.

debug.sh:
Compile the code with optimization turned off and debugging code turned on.

address_sanitize.sh:
Instrument and compile the code with runtime memory error checking. Also 
enables manual memory poisoning debugging tools in the codebase.

thread_sanitize.sh:
Instrument and compile the code with data race checking.

undefined_behaviour_sanitize.sh:
Instrument and compile the code with undefined behaviour runtime checks.


CMake Library Usage and Options
===============================

The library exposes multiple compilation options, both from itself, and from its 
dependencies. The options are:


option(DS_OPTIMIZE "Optimization Flags" OFF):

	DS_OPTIMIZE enables compiler optimization flags in the library. Defaults to 
	OFF.

option(DS_DEBUG "Enable Debug information and assertions, ds_Assert, ..." ON):

	DS_DEBUG builds the library with debug information. Furthermore, it turns on
	general debug macros such as ds_Assert, Breakpoint(condition). Defaults to ON.

option(DS_PROFILE "Enable internal Tracy profiling points and provide Tracy wrapper. "OFF")

	DS_PROFILE turns the Tracy Profiler on or off depending on the set value and
	enables the Dreamscape profiling API wrapping Tracy. Furthermore, if the option
	is enabled, Tracy profile zones within the library is enabled.

option(DS_LOG "DS_LOG enabled the logging API and internal logging points in the library." ON)

	DS_LOG builds the library with internal logging, and provides the loggin API
	to the user.

option(DS_ASAN "Compile the library with address sanitizing, and enable custom poisoning code" OFF):

	DS_ASAN builds the library with address sanitizing. If the user wishes to use
	Asan, the user should compile his or her code with Asan, AND set DS_ASAN; this
 	is important as it enabled custom address poisoning code for both public and
 	internal APIs. Defaults to OFF. Since sanitizing is costly, it is recommended
 	to also set DS_OPTIMIZE to ON.

option(DS_TSAN "Compile the library with thread sanitizing" OFF):

	DS_TSAN builds the library with thread sanitizing. If the user wishes to
	use Tsan, the user should compile his or her code with Tsan, AND set DS_TSAN.
	Defaults to OFF. Since sanitizing is costly, it is recommended to also set 
	DS_OPTIMIZE to ON.

option(DS_UBSAN "Compile the library with undefined behaviour sanitizing" OFF):

	DS_UBSAN builds the library with undefined behaviour sanitizing. If the user
	wishes to use Ubsan, the user should compile his or her code with Ubsan, AND 
	set DS_UBSAN.  Defaults to OFF. Since sanitizing is costly, it is recommended
 	to also set DS_OPTIMIZE to ON.
