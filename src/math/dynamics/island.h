 * |						Persistent Islands						|
 * ==============================================================================================================
 *
 * struct persistent_island: Persistent island over several frames. Justification is that island information
 * may possibly not change much from frame to frame, so storing persistent island data may work as an optimization.
 * It would also be of help in storing cached collision/body data between frames.
 *
 * Operations:
 * 	(1) island_initialize(body)	- Initalize new island from a body (valid for being in an island)
 * 	(2) island_split()		- We must be able to split an island no longer fully connected
 * 	(3) island_merge() 		- We must be able to merge two islands now connected
 *
 * Auxilliary Operation:
 * 	(1)	contact_cache_get_persistent_contacts()	
 * 	(2)	contact_cache_get_new_contacts() * 	(3)	contact_cache_get_deleted_contacts()
 *
 *
 * ----- Island Consistency: Knowing when to split, and when to merge -----
 *
 * In order to know that we should split an island, or merge two islands, we must have ways to reason about
 * the connectivity of islands. The physics pipeline ensure that islands are valid at the start of frames,
 * except perhaps for the first frame. The frame layout should look something like:
 *
 * 	[1] solve island local system
 * 		(1) We may now have broken islands
 * 	[2] finalize bodies, cache contact data  
 * 		(1) Islands contain up-to-date information and caches for bodies (which may no longer be connected) 
 * 		(2) if (cache_map.entry[i] == no_update) => Connection corresponding to entry i no longer exists
 * 	[3] construct new contact_data
 * 		(2) if (cache_map(contact) ==    hit) => Connection remains, (possibly in a new island)
 * 		(3) if (cache_map(contact) == no_hit) => A new connection has been established, 
 * 						         (possibly between two islands)
 *	[4] update/construct islands
 *
 * It follows that if we keep track of 
 *
 *	(1) what contacts were removed from the contact_cache	- deleted links
 *	(2) what contacts were added to the contact cache	- new links
 *	(3) what contacts remain in the contact cache 		- persistent links
 *
 * we have all the sufficient (and necessary) information to re-establish the invariant of correct islands at the
 * next frame.
 *
 *
 * ----- Island Memory: Handling Lifetimes and Memory Layouts (Sanely) -----
 *
 * The issue with persistent islands is that the lifetime of the island is not (generally) shared with to bodies
 * it rules over. It would be possible to limit the islands to using linked lists if we ideally only would have 
 * to iterate each list once. This would greatly simplify the memory management. We consider what data must be
 * delivered to and from the island at what time:
 *
 *
 * FRAME n: 	...
 *	 	...
 * 	==== Contact Cache ====
 * 	[3, 4] construct new contact data + update/construct islands
 * 		list of body indices 		=> island
 * 		list of constraint indices 	=> island
 *
 * FRAME n+1:
 * 	==== Island ====
 * 	[1] solve island local system
 * 		island.constraints.data		=> solver
 * 		island.bodies data		=> solver
 *
 * 	==== Solver ====
 *      [2] finalize bodies, cache contact data
 *		solve.solution			=> contact cache
 *		cache constraints		=> contact cache
 *
 *
 * Assuming that the island only contains linked lists of indices to various data, we wish to fully defer any
 * lookups into that data until the Solver stage. [1] We traverse the lists and retrieve the wanted data. This
 * data (ListData) is kept throughout [2], [3], and discarded at [4] when islands are split/merged.
