/*
 * Issue (1): consumer must be able to atomically get a valid entry AND update so that next valid entry is
 * 	      immediately visible.
 *
 * Solution(1): Reserving an entry is done via a semaphore, and the consumer can then determine which entry
 * 		is entitled to by atomically_icrementing an index. 
 *
 * Issue(2): How does the producer know which entries are free?
 *
 * Solution(2): 
 * 	Publishing: The producer picks the next entry to publish. Before publication, the entry is marked
 * 		    as in_use. If the entry is in_use when the producer first arrive, it should spin until
 * 		    it is no longer marked, or go to sleep. We should perhaps do an assertion here, as it
 * 		    should not happen.
 *
 * 	Releasing: Before the consumer is done with the entry, it should mark the entry as no longer in use,
 * 		   so that the producer may republish the entry.
 *
 * Every entry is marked with a in_use by the producer before publish. When a consumer is 
 * done with the entry, it removes the mark.
